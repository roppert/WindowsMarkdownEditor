WindowsMarkdownEditor
=====================

This is a very simple Markdown Editor for Windows with a split view with an editor on the left side and a live preview on the right. Consider it alpha quality at best.

Makes use of [markdownsharp](https://code.google.com/p/markdownsharp/) and builds as a single EXE.
